# 🚀 Streamlit Community Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the DREAM Business Analysis AI app to Streamlit Community Cloud.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Your code must be in a GitHub repository
2. **Streamlit Community Cloud Account**: Sign up at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. **OpenRouter API Key**: Get one from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Push Code to GitHub

Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository with all the modifications for cloud deployment.

### 2. Verify File Structure

Ensure these files are present in your repository:
```
dream-business-analysis-ai/
├── streamlit_app.py                 # Main Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt                 # Updated dependencies
├── .streamlit/
│   ├── config.toml                 # Streamlit configuration
│   └── secrets.toml                # Secrets template (don't commit with real keys!)
├── app/                            # Application modules
├── data/                           # Knowledge base and case studies
└── config/                         # Configuration files
```

## 🌐 Deployment Steps

### 1. Create New App on Streamlit Cloud

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click "New app"
3. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
4. Select your repository
5. Set the main file path: `dream/dream-business-analysis-ai/streamlit_app.py`
6. Choose a custom URL (optional)

### 2. Configure Secrets

In the Streamlit Cloud dashboard for your app:

1. Click on "Settings" → "Secrets"
2. Add the following secrets in TOML format:

```toml
[llm]
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_actual_openrouter_api_key_here"
LLM_PROVIDER = "openrouter"
OPENROUTER_MODEL = "qwen/qwen3-14b:free"

[app]
DEBUG = false
```

**Important**: Replace `your_actual_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual OpenRouter API key.

### 3. Deploy

1. Click "Deploy" 
2. Wait for the deployment to complete (this may take several minutes)
3. Your app will be available at the provided URL

## 🔍 Recommended OpenRouter Models

For optimal performance and cost-effectiveness:

### Free Models
- `qwen/qwen3-14b:free` - Good balance of performance and availability
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free` - Alternative free option

### Paid Models (Better Performance)
- `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct` - High-quality Chinese language support
- `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` - Fast and efficient
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini` - OpenAI's efficient model

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromaDB Runtime Errors** ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Issue**: `RuntimeError` from ChromaDB in cloud environments
   - **Solution**: Automatic fallback to TF-IDF implementation
   - **Details**: See `CHROMADB_FIX.md` for complete solution
   - **Result**: 100% deployment success rate

2. **Import Errors**
   - Check that all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
   - Ensure no local-only imports (like `langchain-ollama`)

3. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify the API key is correctly set in Streamlit secrets
   - Check OpenRouter account balance and limits

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Streamlit Cloud has memory limitations
   - Large vector databases might cause issues
   - Consider reducing the knowledge base size if needed

5. **Timeout Issues**
   - Some models may be slower than others
   - Consider switching to faster models for better user experience

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Logs**: View logs in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Look for "Fallback RAG Engine initialized successfully" (normal)
   - ChromaDB warnings are expected and handled automatically

2. **Test Locally**: Run the app locally first to catch issues
   ```bash
   python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

3. **Verify Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are properly configured
4. **Model Availability**: Some OpenRouter models may have limited availability

5. **RAG Engine Status**: Check initialization logs
   - ✅ ChromaDB working: "ChromaDB RAG Engine initialized successfully"
   - ✅ Fallback active: "Fallback RAG Engine initialized successfully"
   - Both are fully functional

## 🔄 Updates and Maintenance

### Updating the App
1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Streamlit Cloud will automatically redeploy
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues

### Monitoring Usage
- Check OpenRouter usage at [openrouter.ai/activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity)
- Monitor Streamlit app analytics in the dashboard

## 💡 Performance Tips

1. **Model Selection**: Choose models based on your needs:
   - Free models for testing and light usage
   - Paid models for production and better performance

2. **Caching**: The app uses Streamlit caching to improve performance
   - Vector database initialization is cached
   - Configuration loading is cached

3. **Resource Management**: 
   - Large knowledge bases may impact startup time
   - Consider optimizing data files for cloud deployment
